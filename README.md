This repository contains examples of common coding errors encountered in decentralized applications (DApps). The `bug.js` file demonstrates a function that is vulnerable to a division-by-zero error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling and input validation.  These examples highlight the importance of careful coding practices to ensure the reliability and security of DApps.
